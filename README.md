Cardiac dynamics modelling has been useful for studying and treating arrhythmias. However it is multiscale problem requiring the solution of billions of differential equation describing the complex electrophysiology of the interconnected cells. Therefore, large-scale cardiac modelling has been limited to groups with access to supercomputers and clusters. Many areas of computational science face similar problems where computational costs are too high for personal computers so that supercomputers or clusters are necessary. In this project our main aim is to design a model that makes high-performance simulation of cardiac dynamics that can be run in any modern personal computers and to perform Investigation of optimum Choice of various drugs during cardiovascular dysfunctionalities. Using WebGL platform, we have designed a 2-Dimensional healthy Human heart of a ventricular cell model using O’Hara Virag Varro Rudy (OVVR) electrophysiology mathematical model of Human heart and on that model, also we have performed investigation of different drugs that have been used for treating COVID-19 patients and for treating arrhythmia and their medicinal impact on Human heart and also we have also designed the Human heart failure model. For cardiac dynamics this approach will not only help scientist or students but also physicians to use physiologically accurate modelling which operate in real time.
